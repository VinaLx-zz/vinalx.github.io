## 282. Expression Add Operators

> Given a string that contains only digits 0-9 and a target value, return all possibilities to add binary operators (not unary) `+`, `-`, or `*` between the digits so they evaluate to the target value.

> Examples:
> ```
> "123", 6 -> ["1+2+3", "1*2*3"]
> "232", 8 -> ["2*3+2", "2+3*2"]
> "105", 5 -> ["1*0+5","10-5"]
> "00", 0 -> ["0+0", "0-0", "0*0"]
> "3456237490", 9191 -> []
> ```

## 330. Patching Array

> Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer `n`, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> nums = `[1, 3]`, n = `6`
>
> Return `1`.
>
> Combinations of nums are `[1], [3], [1,3]`, which form possible sums of: `1, 3, 4`.
>
> Now if we add/patch `2` to nums, the combinations are: `[1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]`.
>
> Possible sums are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`, which now covers the range `[1, 6]`.
> So we only need `1` patch.
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> nums = `[1, 5, 10]`, n = `20`
>
> Return `2`.
>
> The two patches can be `[2, 4]`.
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> nums = `[1, 2, 2]`, n = `5`
>
> Return `0`.
